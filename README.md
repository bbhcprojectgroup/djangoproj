**Django is a popular Python open-source web development framework used for rapid web development and clean, pragmatic design.There are three major components to Django’s architecture: elements that aid in working with the database, a template system that works for people who don’t program, and a framework that automates a lot of the website management. This lends itself to a Model, View, Template design pattern:\
Model: defines the structure of the database \
View: defines the logic that returns something from an HTTP request \
Template: defines the structure of how a web page will look with plaintext information that can be read by someone who doesn’t necessarily program.**
